Discover How This 28years Old Former Betting Addict Became An 8-figure Copywriter Within 3years Using..</h1>
<span class="intro">a fool-proof system that increases sales quick and effectively</span>

<p>
The system that can create results like this for you:

Or massive sales similar to this:	
<img src="BOC-Testimonial4.jpg" alt="someone used this system to earn $2857">

<img src="BOC-Testimonial3.jpg" alt="someone used this system to earn approx $720">
	
<img src="BOC-Testimonial2.jpg" alt="someone used this system to earn $610">

<img src="BOC-Testimonial8.jpg" alt="someone used this system to earn $1000">		

This system has worked for thousands of people all over the world and it still works even today.

<b id="red">Before I go on, there's one important thing I need to say...</b>
This was made for complete or intermediate beginners and not experts.

So if you are an expert this would be more like a class revision for you.

It is also not for increasing or sharpening your copywriting skill.

It is for total beginners who just want to learn copywriting from scratch and increase their sales.

It is not a "get-rich-quick" system.

This is not about affiliate marketing although the system works for affiliate marketing too.

With the many Expertnaire affiliates that exist, Nigerians have become so suspicious that if they hear anything about making "millions" or words like "secrets", "systems", they'll think it is affiliate marketing.

<b id="red">But you know what?</b>I am not going to promise you that you'll earn something from this system immediately you start using it.

Cause knowledge, implemention and experience plays a lot in getting results with this system.

This is not the "Ultimate Guide" to making sales, you'll have to learn more about the skill yourself after the class.

And this college is not for lazy people.

You'll have to learn how to extract information from the videos you watch and be able to explain it in your own words.

You'll have to write your own copy and test it.

You'll have to do your assignments religiously and practise for this system to work for you.

So if you're not willing to do any of that or you don't have the time for it(or you don't want to create the time)...

You can just stop reading this page right now and continue whatever you were doing before you got here.

But for those who are truly interested, let's continue.

It all began many years ago when I had just gotten my admission to study in the University Of Uyo, I thought I had finally arrived...

I studied microbiology for 4 years.

Graduated with a 2'1

Spent over a million naira in the course of my four years in school fees, feeding expenses, accommodation, school materials, transport fares..

What did I get in return?...

Nothing! Absolutely nothing. 

The only money I've made from Microbiology is the one ITF paid me for doing industrial training.

Even that one was just N15,000.

One day, I decided to try my luck on betting to see if I would win at least some money to be able to take care of myself.

<b>Unfortunately I ended up becoming addicted to betting...</b>
I realized I couldn't stop myself any longer, any money I got was spent on betting and as usual i lost the money.

I continued living like that because I was a slave to addiction.

Until I gave my life to Christ and became a Christian.

I changed my ways and got a job as a private teacher earning 95,000naira ($229.31).

In 2016, I learnt about a skill by which one could generate leads, increase sales dramatically, get more clients and do many other things.

I focused my energy on learning the skill and systems that was needed for it to operate properly and I started to make use of it.

<b>Now, I have made over 90 million naira and trained more than 500 people in becoming millionaires with this skill.</b>
I also set up an automation system so that even if I stop working today, I will still be receiving credit alerts daily.

</p>
	
<h2>But who are you?</h2>
<p>
Now let's do a proper introduction.
<img src="Emmanuel-Akpe.jpg" alt="introduction: Emmanuel Akpe Photo">		
My name is Emmanuel Akpe, also known as the Prince Of Copywriting.
I am an eight figure copywriter with great results, that has affected the lives of 16,000+ people positively both directly and indirectly.

I have worked with brands like Elisha Mamman, I've been interviewed by FNISBC, I've spoken on copywriting with Franklin Emmanuel on his YouTube channel.

<img src="Emma-Akpe-Elisha-Mamman.jpg" alt="Emmanuel Akpe With Elisha Mamman">		
And I helped raise up many great copywriters such as Esther Odeminigwe(Smilepreneur), Isaiah Ibigbemi (He's great at Upwork) and Pendullum(Godsplan K. Ugwuja).

I have trained over 16,000+ people in copywriting and have also assisted 500+ people in becoming millionaires.<b id="red">So how did this great change happen?</b>I learnt about how humans think and how I can use that to my advantage - legally

I learnt about human psychology and how I could use them to get clients and sell my services.

I read copywriting, self-development books and consumed them all like as if the world was going to end the next day.

I discovered that copywriting was part of the way we think.

We all use copywriting, some way or the other but we don't easily realize it.

</p>

<h2>So what is copywriting?</h2>
<p>
<b>Copywriting is a skill used to write words that make people to do something.

Copywriting is simply persuasive words written down to convince, engage and of course to make money.</b>
It is used by famous brands such as Indomie, Golden Penny, Gucci, Coca Cola, Kelloggs, just name any famous brand you know.

Also politicians, Bet9ja, advertisers, companies and all kinds of people you won't easily think of.

And yes it can be used to get people to buy, to increase clients or get more followers on Instagram.

<b>So what can copywriting do for me?</b>
With copywriting, you can work at your 9-5 jobs and do copywriting as a side hustle and still make much money.

With copywriting, you can increase the sales of any other skills you have, the lessons in copywriting can be applied to your other businesses.

Just like I do most of the time, even when I travel I still make money by using copywriting in my ten* other sources of income.

With copywriting you can grow your shop or salon and people will rush to be your customers.

With copywriting, you can learn how marketing works and set up systems, automate funnels and watch the money flow in.

Most business in Nigeria suffer because they are expecting God to send them clients from the sky and that jobs will just appear all of a sudden.

They don't try to advertise their businesses so that people can know about them and most times they don't even know how to market their products and services well enough.

But with copywriting, you will learn how to advertise your businesses well and get more customers.

With copywriting, you won't have to be looking at those expertnaire affiliates alerts while your bank account is almost empty.

With copywriting you can chill with the big boys and drink cold juice with fresh hot and peppered suya.

</p>

<h2>And YOU don't need a 100%<br>mark in English to practise copywriting</h2>
<p>
To practise copywriting, you don't need to know much english.
Yes, I mean it.

You don't even need to get first class in English in order to use copywriting.

I got C5 in English.
Surprised?

Even if you have never gotten first position in school you can use copywriting and it will work.

You don't need any degree or certificate or whatever, name it, to do copywriting.

Even if you have been labeled as a 'dummy' or a 'failure' in class, you can still be successful with copywriting.

Robert Kiyosaki (a multi-billionaire real estate investor)was not what our teachers would call 'intelligent' in terms of school education as he even said in his book 'Rich Dad, Poor Dad', he wasn't a 'whiz' kid.

But still he is a successful and wealthy man partly due to copywriting.

You can do a lot of great things as a copywriter.

All you need is an eager mind, determination, a phone with charged battery and internet connection.

<b id="red">But as you should know, nothing legal comes easy in this world,</b>
You'll have to work hard to get powerful results like that in copywriting.

You'll have to work, learn, test and keep testing to get great results.

And I will not speak sweet words to you, telling you that you'd be able to sit down enjoying yourself in Dubai and earn millions of dollars per hour without doing working/learning.

You'll have to think harder and smarter and be more persistent than a normal employee.

This is what makes a lot of people to give up, not knowing that everything has it's time before it shines.

Even the sun doesn't shine immediately it's morning.

And as for how much you'll earn,
It depends on the kind of right effort, experience and time you put into it.

<b>How long will it take me to start making money with copywriting?</b>
I don't usually like to state numbers of months or years cause it depends.

It could be six months but if you don't have the determination or the right circumstance around you (e.g electricity to charge phone, food to eat) then the time period will increase even more.

If during that six months or one year you make no action to get better or learn more stuff in copywriting, you won't get much results.

Copywriting isn't a one time subject that can be finished in one course or class, the best anyone can do for you is to teach or show you either the basics or intermediate and expert ways of writing copy.

</p>

<h2>What does a copywriter do?</h2>
<p>
<b>A copywriter is a person that writes words to convince people to do something.
A copywriter writes stuff like:</b>
The words or acts you see in a video ad, they write the scripts used in them.

They write the words used on websites, landing pages, influencer social media pages.

They also write newspaper advertisements, facebook adverts and billboard adverts.

They write slogans for business, they sometimes create the brand name a business will use.
<b>When you know what triggers the emotions of mankind and make them to act, you can write copy.
</b>

<b id="red">
How do I learn copywriting?</b>If you want the easiest way of learning copywriting, go to YouTube and search for "How To Become A Copywriter".

Join Facebook copywriting groups and see what the experts have to say.

Subscribe to YouTube channels like Dan Lok, Sabri Suby, Alex Cattoni and many more which I can't mention.

However there are many fake copywriting teachers and coaches out there with only theories to deliver.

Who haven't practised and made money with their skills so I won't suggest you pay for any common copywriting class so you won't invest your money in the wrong place.

</p>

<h2>But what if you could....</h2>
<p>What if you could get access to learning the system I and our copywriting legends have used to increase sales easily?

Just imagine what results you could get if you can get access to a platform like that where you learn that tested and proven system with others.

Then when you eventually learn that system, you practise it and increase your sales 3x or 10x within 90days.

What would that do for you?

It would be such a glorious day when you finally know how to double your sales, get customers and make money.

Or is it nice to have low sales?
Don't you want a change?

Do you want to keep posting pictures of your products and then no one buys?

I haven't had a day without credit alerts from sales of my digital products for two years now so I don't know how it feels.<b id="red">But without wasting of time..</b>

<h2>What's MY Guarantee?</h2>
<p>
I and my team have been running BOC (Bachelor Of Copywriting College)for twenty-five editions now and over 17,000 people from different countries have joined the college.

It's been 4 years now and to be frank if I fail to fulfil my promises my reputation would be destroyed in the eyes of my mentor Elisha Mamman and over 17,000 people.

<b id="red">Who would want to do that to themselves?</b>
Certainly a wise person would not do that.
Plus I want to keep the title 'Prince Of Copywriting' as a true title and not one that has been overhyped by gullible men.

So obviously it won't be in my or your best interest if I don't deliver on all the promises mentioned above.

If after you join this college, you realize that this is just some overhyped class that has nothing juicy or valuable to your life, then do message me personally and I will return your money back fully.

If I don't return your money, I give you permission to screenshot your message to me and disgrace me on Facebook and WhatsApp to show the world what a fraud I am and save others from falling in the same trap.

<b>But come to think of it...</b>
If I were a fraud, why do you think they said this?
<img src="BOC-Testimonial5.jpg" alt="someone used this system to earn $1000">

Or why do you think the famous Olorunfemi Prosperity joined the 15th edition of BOC?
<img src="BOC-Testimonial-OP.jpg" alt="Olorunfemi Prosperity">
	
Or how come this happened?
<img src="BOC-Testimonial9.jpg" alt="Olorunfemi Prosperity">
<br>	
</p>

<h1 class="red">Let's just face the facts</h1>
<p>All these couldn't have happ-ened if I were a fraud or if BOC was a class with absolutely no value.

Even if you can't believe my words, then surely you can know through the works that BOC has done in the lives of many that BOC is indeed a college of copywriting.


</p>

<h1 class="red">So how do I gain access<br/>to this college?</h1>
<p>
Certainly a college filled with value worth over a million naira can't be free.
You are right, it's not free.

And yes I don't feel a bit guilty over this.
<b id="red">Here's why</b>
It took years of hardship and learning to get to where I am today.

I endured a lot of insults, disgrace and passed through fire to get here and do you suppose it right for me to give away all the information I have learnt throughout these years for free?

No, it is not justifiable nor wise.
Cause if access to this college were free, then it would get devalued by men who don't know the great value of it.

The price tag I put on it is just a means of draining out the undesirable men who think that they should get everything for free regardless of what it took for the owner to get it.

It's like saying someone who went through great dangers to find the antidote to HIV/AIDS and finally found it should give it away for free.
So that means he should get nothing for his labour?

Even Jesus told his disciples that the worker is worthy of his hire.
In other words he deserves it.

But because I know the great burden that lies on  mankind already: The expenses for food, light, shelter, entertainment, school, clothing and many others...

I made the price to access this college extremely affordable so much that I can boldly say that you'll hardly find any other reputable and famous copywriter who'll write copy for such a low price.

To be sincere, this is more like me taking a loss, considering what it took me to get it.

But I'll do it for my fellow men who are already trying their best to learn about digital skills. 

I would still be justified if access to this college were 40,000naira which is just 3.2% of the worth of the bonuses.

But don't worry, it's not upto that.
It's just 20,000naira.

But if you pay before 15th of August 2022(resumption date), you'll get in there for a discount price of 5,000naira.

If you are a lady, then this is the lowest you'll pay a makeup artist for a simple makeup.

And yet your makeup cannot help you to make sales or can it?

Will it increase your bank account figure?
No it won't.

We'll soon start our 27th edition and classes will start on the 15th of August.
